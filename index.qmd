## General Information

**What**: This workshop provides a practical introduction to foundational machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, random forest, and XGBoost, with hands-on applications and best practices using tidymodels in R. Note that this workshop will NOT cover Large Language Models (LLMs) and while it may touch on Neural Network (NN)/Deep Learning models briefly at the end of the workshop, these will not be the focus.

**Who**: This workshop is designed for researchers, staff, and students who want to gain experience using machine learning techniques in practice in the R programming language. 

**Prerequisites**: Participants should be familiar with the basics of the R programming language, including the tidyverse. Participants do *not* need to have any previous machine learning, statistical or mathematical experience to attend this workshop.

**Requirements**: Participants must bring a laptop onto which they can [download R and Rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (and you should do so before the workshop).

**Contact**: Please email andrew.george@hsc.utah.edu and rebecca.barter@hsc.utah.edu for more information.



## Resources


### Posit Cloud

A Posit Cloud workspace will be set up prior to the workshop for those who cannot (or prefer not to) install applications on their laptop. Check back before the workshop for the link to the workspace.


### Download files and data


If you are working in RStudio locally (rather than using posit cloud, above) [click here](content.zip "download") to download all of the .R code scripts and data files we will be using throughout the workshop. 


## Schedule

Note that the schedule below serves as a guideline. The start, end, and break times are fixed, but timing for each topics covered may vary as we may go faster or slower through the content.

**Note that morning snacks and lunch will be provided on both days**.
